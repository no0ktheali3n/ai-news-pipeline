1,1,"Sculpting Subspaces: Constrained Full Fine-Tuning in LLMs for Continual Learning
🧠✨ Exciting AI breakthrough alert! 🚀 Scientists have cracked the code on making language models learn new tricks without forgetting old ones. It's like teaching an old dog new tricks, but the dog remembers ALL its tricks!",302,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07097,#AI #ContinualLearning #LLM #CatastrophicForgetting
1,2,"🐶🎓

This clever method, using some fancy math called ""adaptive SVD,"" lets AI models keep learning without getting brain freeze. 🧊🤯 The result? AI that's smarter, more flexible, and doesn't need a gazillion extra parts to keep growing. Now that's what we call a win-win! 🏆🎉",272,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07097,#AI #ContinualLearning #LLM #CatastrophicForgetting
