## 🔐 Best Practices Decision: Secrets Manager Timing

**Current Plan:**
- Deploy to AWS Lambda (v0.6.0) with `.env`-based secret injection
- Migrate to **AWS Secrets Manager** in `v0.8.0` after validating CI/CD infrastructure

### ✅ Why Not Immediately Before Lambda?
- Secrets Manager integration introduces IAM policy design, retrieval logic, and potentially encryption/decryption policies.
- Jumping into that *before* verifying the Lambda package works as expected could obscure where errors are coming from (Secrets vs Logic).

### 🔐 Justification for `v0.8.0` Timing:
| Criteria                | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧪 Separation of Concerns | Decouples functional bugs from permission/config issues                      |
| 🔄 CI/CD Alignment       | Once deployment pipeline exists, secure secret loading can be validated      |
| ⚙️ Policy Flexibility     | Gives time to write least-privilege IAM roles with confidence                |
| 🧼 Rollback Safety        | Easier to roll back `.env` than reconfigure Secrets/IAM mid-deployment       |

We want to **ensure logic correctness before security plumbing**.

## 🛠️ Bonus Considerations (Possible Future Releases)

| Idea                        | Use Case                                                              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| v1.1.0: Article ranking     | Only post top-N based on scoring (attention, novelty, tags)           |
| v1.2.0: Markdown exporter   | Export summaries to GitHub wiki / Notion / HTML newsletter            |
| v1.3.0: Web dashboard       | Visualize summaries and tweet statuses (React + API Gateway)          |
| v2.0.0: Feed Integrator     | Integrate HN, Reddit, Twitter Trends with a multimodal summarizer loop|
