# scraper-alpha
simple scraper that writes table elements into a text-based list <br>
-
thought it would be a good exercise to write a simple scraper for the purposes of building a user-agent list to use in a more sophisticated scraper

...originally.... <br>  
i was building a list of user agents to build a txt file to feed a random function to rotate them to build a cooler scraper <br>
.... <br>
then i discovered puppeteer libs that have functions for all that so im prob gonna use that going forward <br>
might try to revise this one into a puppeteer script for funsies <br>
